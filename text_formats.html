      The Shaniwar Wada was normally the seven-story capital building of the
      Peshwas of the Maratha Empire. It was supposed to be made entirely of
      stone. However, after the completion of the base floor or the first story,
      the people of Satara (the national capital) complained to the Chhatrapati
      Shahu I saying that a stone monument can be sanctioned and built only by
      the Chhatrapati himself and not the Peshwas. Following this, an official
      letter was written to the Peshwas stating that the remaining building had
      to be made of brick and not stone.

      By 1758, at least a thousand people lived in the fort. In 1773,
      Narayanrao, who was the fifth and ruling Peshwa then, was murdered by
      guards on orders of his uncle Raghunathrao and aunt Anandibai. A popular
      legend has it that Narayanrao's ghost still calls for help on full moon
      nights. Various people, working around the area, have allegedly reported
      the cries of "Kaka mala vachava" (Uncle, save me) by Narayanrao Peshwa
      after his death. The book, Assassination of the Peshwa, written in English
      and Marathi, covers this incident in detail.[3][2][4][5]
